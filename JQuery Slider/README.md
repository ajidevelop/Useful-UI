# JQuery Slider

This slider is a simple slider that's set to auto play the slides and stop whenever a user clicks on the navigation bar.
The slider is as easy as adding new images. It automatically accounts for the number of images. Now you no longer
 have to edit javascript or css for the slider to get it to work. It's as simple as creating a new `div` element with
  a class of `slide` and adding the `img` tag inside the parent `div`.
